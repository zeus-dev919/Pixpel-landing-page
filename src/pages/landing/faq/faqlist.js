        question: "How does the NFT insurance policy work?",
        answer: "The NFT insurance policy works by holding a percentage of the transaction for the NFT protected by it. The percentage is held in a smart contract for a fixed period with the option to be extended. Once the period ends, it is released. The policy was created to fight against the biggest problem crypto projects faceâ€”rug pulls and rug slips. By implying our unique NFT insurance, users can feel more confident investing, while developers receive more trust from their users without losing funds, for as long as their intentions are truthful."
